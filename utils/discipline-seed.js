                description: "By looking into the eyes of an animal and perhaps making some related sound (like growling or hissing), you are capable of communicating with the creature. Your predatory nature allows you to understand and cow natural creatures. De- pending on your predilections, you may deal with the animal equitably, or you may demand obedience. The animal may not wish to obey, but this Discipline’s power insures that the animal is at least favorably disposed toward you. Even if the animal is intractable, you may be able to force it into submission. Using this power requires that you look into the eyes of the creature with which you desire to communicate; if this gaze is lost, then you must attempt to re-establish contact if you wish to continue communicating. Most animals will continue to attend your gaze while you are communicating with them, though. Animals without eyes, or very simple in nature, do not have enough of a mind or Beast to connect with easily. This power works best with predatory creatures and larger birds, reptiles and mammals. You may communicate with animals without any test. However, to issue commands, you must defeat the animal in a Social Challenge — generally, the animal will have the equivalent of six to eight Traits for this challenge, as de- termined by a Narrator. If you succeed, you can count on the animal following your orders for the remainder of the evening. Most animals lack the intelligence necessary to carry out complex or conditional commands, but they can perform simple tasks like fetching, following people or guarding locations.",

Depending on how you couch your call, you can summon all animals of a particular type within the area, or just a few. The creatures hasten to your Beckoning, ready to aid or simply to provide nourishment. Though animals called by this power do not fall under your control automatically, they are at least favorably inclined toward you. You must expend a Social Trait for each animal that you summon. Only animals that can hear the summons respond; you cannot call a bird from across a city, nor could you call an animal that cannot hear. You may be as specific as you desire within the category of summoned animals. For instance, you may choose to summon all the rats in an area, or just the white ones, or even a specific rat that you know about. Animals summoned with this power may take some time to arrive. Your Storyteller can issue cards for your animals or swarms, as appropriate. Animals summoned with this power remain as long as they are not attacked or threatened (within their conception — a rat would certainly feel threatened by the move- ments of several people in the area), or until the scene ends. You can use other Animalism powers normally to command or control the animals called.",

Your Beast serves to show your ultimate mastery over your prey, cowing humans and animals alike into submission. Without the inner fire of powerful emotions, the subject is apathetic. Different vampires evoke this power in different ways. Nosferatu most com- monly soothe the Beasts of their subjects, drawing them into lassitude, while Tzimisce and Gangrel often assert their mastery over lesser subjects and terrify the victims into submission. Regardless of the means, the results are similar; any vampire using this Discipline can choose her particular style. No speech or vocalization is necessary — only the physical or eye contact. You must engage in a Social Challenge with your victim in order to use this power. Once you have intimidated or soothed the subject, he may no longer use Willpower Traits for the remainder of the evening. Such a subject also gains the Negative Traits Submissive x 2, for the same duration. Multiple uses of this power are not cumulative; once affected, the victim cannot receive additional Submissive Traits through further uses of this Discipline. Cowing the Beast of a vampire is much more difficult. You must expend a Willpower Trait to make the attempt (before engaging in the Social Challenge). If successful, the vampire suffers from the normal effects of this power. Alternately, you may use this power on a vampire in frenzy, causing the Cainite to snap back into lucidity. In such a case, you expend the Willpower Trait and make the Social Challenge as usual, but if you succeed, the vampire merely returns to lucidity instead of suffering the other effects of this Discipline. You may not use this Discipline on yourself.",

                description: "Locking eyes with an animal, you can now move your consciousness into its body, dominating it completely. Your soul pushes aside the animal’s weaker spirit, and your own body falls into a comatose state, while your spirit uses the animal as a vessel. Though influenced by the animal’s bestial nature, you can still exercise your intellect and even some of your supernatural capabilities. You are limited by the physical constraints of any animal that you possess — your physical Disciplines do not augment the creature, nor do you have the ability to speak or manipulate objects if that is normally outside of the animal’s physical capabilities. However, you can use the animal’s natural abilities, such as claws, wings, poison and gills. There is no functional limit to the distance at which you can exercise this Disci- pline once you have possessed an animal — you may move freely in the animal’s body, even in sunlight (subject to the normal restrictions for remaining awake during the day), without concern for your vampiric form. However, you are not automatically aware of what transpires around your comatose body. If your animal form suffers injury, your vampiric body suffers equal sympathetic injury; if the animal body is slain, your soul returns to your body and you enter torpor. Should you choose to leave the animal’s body for your own, this happens regardless of distance as long as you are conscious. However, you must declare this intent at the beginning of the turn and survive until the end of the turn (if you are in combat or other dangerous situations). Fleeing the animal body does not require an action; you may still act normally in the turn that you intend to return to your body. If you are injured (with- out being knocked unconscious) while attempting to return to your own body, you must make a Simple Test — a tie indicates that you remain in the grip of animalistic behavior for the rest of the scene, and a failure causes you to immediately enter frenzy, though in both cases you return to your Cainite form automatically. If your vampiric body dies while you inhabit an animal’s form, you can try to remain in the animal body. Each sunrise, you must make a Simple Test (win or tie). If you lose, your spirit plunges into the astral realms, gone forever. Thus, you have only a short time to survive. Exercising this power requires that you gaze into the eyes of the beast that you intend to possess (if the animal has no eyes, you may not possess it). You must then expend Social Traits to move into the animal’s body. The more Social Traits you choose to expend, the more complete your connection to the animal form. With simple possession, you direct the body as you choose; more complete dominance allows you to use some of your own Disciplines while in the body. Once you have used this power, you suffer from some of the animal’s habits and instincts. For each Social Trait expended on the possession, you suffer from one Negative Trait of Feral. These Traits remain until you overcome the animal’s behavior patterns by expending Willpower Traits — one Willpower Trait for each Negative Trait removed. You should roleplay the animal’s mannerisms, even after returning to your own body, until you have managed to remove these Negative Traits, although you can slowly overcome them by spending Willpower Traits over time (you need not try to overcome all of the Feral habits at once).",

                description: "Your mastery over the Beast Within is superb. Through your keen under- standing of predatory nature and the ability to influence other creatures, you can draw out your own Beast, pushing your frenzy on others. Animals and ghouls are favored targets for this power, turning them into killing machines, but you can attempt to exert your Beast on anyone. You must be on the verge of frenzy to use this Discipline. You exert this power in lieu of making any Virtue Test to control your frenzy. Instead, you make a Social Challenge against any individual within your line of sight. Doing so does not cost an action; you may attempt this feat any time that you are about to frenzy. If you win, your frenzy is transferred to the victim. The hapless recipient immediately enters frenzy and even manifests some of your personality, habits and speech patterns (which should be roleplayed — typically, characters with the Investigation Ability may recognize your man- nerisms in the victim). The victim remains in a normal frenzy, while you are unaffected and unable to frenzy for the duration. Should the victim die while frenzied, though, the screaming Beast immediately returns to you, requiring you to make a Virtue Test or to exercise this power again. If you lose, you instead frenzy immediately with no Virtue Test, and you are unable to fight against your frenzy with Willpower Traits. While the Beast is loosed in a victim, you remain complacent and placid. However, if the victim leaves your sight before the frenzy is over, you lose your Beast, suffering as if subjected to Quell the Beast — you cannot use Willpower Traits and you gain the Negative Traits Submissive x 2. You must find the recipi- ent of your Beast and “convince” the Beast to return by acting in a monstrous fashion, or else kill the victim so that the Beast returns automatically.",

By drawing on this feral connection, vampires can communicate with and control animals. Indeed, vampires who develop a communion with their animal side often seem attractive or at least masterful to most animals. This Discipline is practiced by the Gangrel, Nosferatu, Ravnos and Tzimisce clans; the Gangrel and Nosferatu often establish equitable or friendly relationships with natural creatures, while the Tzimisce show their mastery over lesser life forms through this power. Ravnos find animals to be useful scouts, spies and meals in their nomadic travels. Use the Animal Ken Ability for retests with the Animalism Discipline."

Your eyesight and hearing sharpen to twice your mortal limits, while your touch, smell and taste are acute enough to pick out tiny details and features with ease. You can sharpen any or all of your senses, as desired. Furthermore, you sometimes have flashes of insight, preternatural awareness of danger or future events. Any senses augmented by this Discipline function at twice normal effectiveness, allowing you to spot hidden foes, hear the rustle of leaves outside, taste a bit of poison in vitae, read a hand-written note by touch and smell incense burned hours ago. Should your senses be overwhelmed, though, you may be stunned temporarily. A loud gunshot, a flash of light or other overwhelming factor can incapacitate one of your senses for a time, causing you to lose the benefits of this Discipline. Furthermore you remain completely stunned for one turn, and you lose the sharpened sense in question for the duration of the scene, unless you expend a Willpower Trait to keep your wits about you.",

The interplay of colors in this aura gives you insight into the subject’s emotions, motives and true nature. This Discipline is notice- able, though, as you stare at the subject with intense concentration. You must be able to see your target in order to use Aura Perception. You then spend a turn in concentration and make a Static Mental Challenge with a difficulty of the target’s number of Mental Traits (more complex targets are harder to read). Since using this power is a Static Test, the target may not relent or retest. If you succeed, you may ask any one of the following questions, which the subject must answer truthfully: What is your current mood/emotional state? What sort of creature are you (human, vampire, werewolf, etc., subject to your knowledge of such beings and their auras)? Are you under the effects of any form of magic? Have you committed diablerie (see the section on diablerie, p. 216, for how long this form of detection is viable)? Was the last thing you said a lie? Aura Perception also allows you to sense ghosts and astral forms. If you suspect the presence of a ghost in an area, you may expend a Mental Trait to make a normal challenge to sense its aura, as described previously. If you succeed, you are aware of the ghost’s aura as a pale, flickering and amorphous light, though this is not sufficient for you to identify specific individual ghosts.",

                description: "Every being leaves traces of its thoughts and emotions wherever it goes. With this Discipline, you can read these psychic impressions from objects that others have handled, or that have strong emotional events tied to them. A simple touch and a moment of concentration unlocks a flood of images and sensations, possibly giving insight into the past of the item. Note that you may only use this power on objects or places, not on people, vampires, animals or other living creatures. By touching an item and expending a Mental Trait for a turn of concentration, you gain a brief flash of insight into any powerfully emotional events surrounding the object in question. Each use of this power on an object allows you to ask a Nar- rator one of the following questions, requiring a truthful answer: Who last touched this object (before me)? Was this object used in any emotionally stressful events, like a murder, a passionate romance or a maniacal rage? What strong emotions drove a particular subject holding this object? Answers to these questions gener- ally come in the form of images and impressions; you may not get exact names or lists of information, but instead distorted pictures, flashes of sudden passion and repeating sounds and voices. It is up to you to interpret such information. Using this power on objects charged with particularly powerful emotions — a knife used to kill someone, a blanket clutched during childbirth, a bizarre puzzle that drove someone to insanity — may cause you to be temporarily overcome with emotions that are not your own. At the discretion of a Narrator or Storyteller, you may temporarily suffer from a derangement for the rest of the scene.",

                description: "Projecting your senses outward, you can pierce the shroud of reason in the minds of others, drawing forth their very thoughts. You can link your conscious- ness to anyone you can see, sending or receiving concepts that you and the target “hear” in your respective minds. In order to use Telepathy, you must make a Mental Challenge against your subject. A willing subject may relent to this mental contact, but there is no way to identify the originator of a given telepathic missive short of making contact (or you choose to identify yourself). You must also spend a full turn in concentration, focusing on your subject. If you succeed, you establish a brief link, allowing you to send or scan thoughts as long as you maintain the contact. You may issue a stream of thoughts that the subject “hears” as a single concept, or you can pluck a thought from the victim, asking a single question and demanding a truthful answer. Legitimate secrets that can be uncovered are anything that could be discerned with Aura Perception, as well as such questions as: What is the appearance of a person, place or item about which you are speaking? What is the name of a person, place or item about which you are speaking? What element have you omitted from your answer to a question, if any? What is the true answer to a question that you have lied about? What memories do you have of one topic (querent’s choice) of current conversation? If you choose to interrogate an unwilling victim, you must make a Mental Challenge for each question asked; if simply communicating normally, no additional challenges are required. With effort, you can probe deep into the consciousness of an open mind, drawing out hidden secrets or buried memories. Doing so allows you to ask more detailed ques- tions than the cursory ones usually employed with Telepathy. By expending a Mental Trait after establishing a successful telepathic link, you may ask and expect a truthful response to: What is one of your Flaws or Negative Traits, if any (subject’s choice)? What is one of your derangements, if any (subject’s choice)? Each question asked requires a Static Mental Challenge against the subject’s Mental Traits, and the subject may not relent — you are delving deep into the mind, which reacts automatically to defend against intrusion. At Storyteller discretion,Telepathy may discern clumsy uses of Dominate, particu- larly of Forgetful Mind, but with a great deal of effort. The most common means of doing so is to establish a link and begin asking questions, as described in the paragraph above. A second Static Mental Challenge against the subject’s Mental Traits may allow you to spot gaps in a memory or where a memory has been poorly reconstructed. Modern vampires compare such gaps to be like watching a badly spliced film. Communication with Telepathy proceeds in impulses, images and feelings, and it does not rely on the use of a common language, so even people who do not speak the same language may make themselves understood. Individuals unused to the sud- den onslaught of Telepathy may be momentarily stunned or disoriented by projected thoughts, at the Narrator’s discretion. Telepathy may also be used simply to eavesdrop; scanning someone telepathically is invisible and largely undetectable, unless another character with Telepathy tries to “listen in” on the link (using a Static Mental Chal- lenge against the scanner). Such eavesdropping can only be used on surface thoughts. Beware, though — if you force your way into someone’s mind without permission, the target may make a Willpower Challenge to force you to break off your link. You may only use your Telepathy on one subject at a time, but this limit does not preclude someone else from using her own Telepathy on you. If you contact a subject and then use your Telepathy on someone else, your link to the first subject collapses and must be re-established later. Using Telepathy on a supernatural creature is a taxing exercise, and it requires the expenditure of a Mental Trait. This Trait is expended before the Mental Challenge is made to establish the link. Telepathy only functions on beings with conscious thought. The Discipline has no effect on constructs that are not self-aware or on normal animals.",

Thus untethered, your consciousness roams various planes of thought, allowing you to spy on areas all over the world as an incorporeal spirit. Without the concerns of mass and matter, you easily pass through any physical barrier and move at the speed of thought to any place on Earth, under the orbit of the moon. While your senses are projected, your body lies in a comatose state, un- aware of its surroundings. Your psychic form does not tire from travel, nor is it hindered or injured by the material world. Indeed, you are completely invisible and intangible, unable to affect anything physically. However, your spirit-form can still sense its surroundings normally, even using your other powers of Auspex. Your immaterial form is tied to your material corpse through a silver cord, a sort of psychic tether that keeps you from becoming lost in the realms of spirit. Sending your senses out in this fashion requires the expenditure of a Willpower Trait. You may remain out of your body as long as you like, though the rise of the sun over your physical form may force you into slumber. Furthermore, by expending an additional Willpower Trait, you can manifest for a single turn as an intangible apparition, allowing you to be seen and to speak audibly. While materialized, you can use any of your Mental or Social Disciplines simply by expending a Mental Trait before making the appropriate additional expenditures or challenges. While visible, you appear as an idealized form of yourself, complete with projected trappings, though your real-world physical possessions do not come with you in spirit form. Even while visible, you remain intangible and thus immune to injury from conventional sources like claws, fire, sunlight and mundane weapons (although your comatose body can still be harmed). While in astral form, you may not possess other bodies, even if you have that talent in Dominate. You may deal normally with other astral forms that you encounter, conversing and using Mental or Social Disciplines. You may even attempt to injure other astral travelers by attacking their silver cord. Such astral combat uses Mental Challenges, with damage causing the opponent to lose Willpower Traits. Once an astral combatant runs out of Willpower Traits, his silver cord snaps, stranding him in the spirit realms. From there, the spirit may accidentally wander deeper into other worlds (such as the Dark Umbra in Oblivion or the Realms described in Laws of the Wild), or he may stumble about until he finds a way to return to his body. Some spirits thus trapped never return, captured or devoured by monstrous entities that dwell in the astral plane. While astral, your consciousness exists in a mental projection of the mate- rial world. You cannot directly interact with or see wraiths, Umbral spirits or Garou (see Oblivion and Laws of the Wild), unless you find a means to travel to or sense the other spirit worlds. Similarly, your astral form is invisible and intangible to them unless you manifest in the physical world.",

        description: "A predator’s senses must be fearfully acute, so many vampires hone their sensory talents to incredible sharpness. This improved awareness starts merely by expanding physical senses, but as a vampire’s powers of perception grow, consciousness itself becomes fleeting and sublime. Such a heightened awareness encompasses subtle textures and emotional states, transcending the physical limitations of the body while developing sharpness of the mind. The powers of Auspex grant the ability to see through supernatural deception. With such focused attention, Auspex can even pierce the veils of Chimerstry and Obfuscate. Whenever Auspex is active (a conscious choice on the vampire’s part), a Mental Challenge may be made with an opponent to try to see through the illu- sions of Chimerstry or the misdirection of Obfuscate. Winning this challenge with Auspex penetrates the deceptive powers. Losing, though, indicates that the vampire is affected normally. For each level of difference between the subject’s Obfuscate or Chimerstry and the searcher’s Auspex, there is a Trait modifier on a one-for- one basis in the event of ties or overbids. For example, a searching vampire with Telepathy (an intermediate level of Auspex) counts two additional Traits against an opponent who only knows Unseen Presence, a Basic level of Obfuscate. This bonus applies even when not using the full level of these Disciplines; an individual hid- ing with Mask of a Thousand Faces is still very difficult to detect if his mastery of Obfuscate has reached the Advanced level of Cloak the Gathering. A chance to see through supernatural concealment always exists, but doing so is much more likely if the searcher’s Auspex powers are highly advanced and/ or the opponent’s powers are weak. When using a Heightened Sense, hold up a number of fingers based on your power level (one for Basic, two for Intermediate, three for Advanced). The Auspex Discipline is most evidenced by the Tremere, Tzimisce and Malkavian clans, who use it for supernatural insights, and by the Toreador, who use their superb senses in conjunction with their artistic work. Auspex powers retest with the Investigation Ability. Willpower may be used for a single retest when attempting to spot an Obfuscated or otherwise hidden individual — in such a case, the vampire focuses his senses and concentrates fiercely, redoubling his searching efforts."

        description: "As one of the physical augmenting Disciplines of vampires, Celerity repre- sents preternatural speed and reflexes. When angered, stressed or consumed with need, a Cainite can use the power inherent in the blood to fuel her actions, moving with startling quickness. If attacked by surprise (see p.200), the victim may not use Celerity in the initial challenge — she must respond with her normal reflexes, and can only draw on her vampiric speed once she has reacted to the surprise. The Celerity Discipline is most common among the Assamite, Brujah and Tore- ador clans. The former two tend to use the powers of Celerity in battle, while the latter engages in feats of dance, rapid completion of artwork or to flee from danger. Since Celerity simply grants additional actions or modifiers to speed, it does not draw retests from any Ability. Actions performed with Celerity can still be retested appropriately (if shooting a gun twice, for instance, Firearms is used normally for a retest on each shot). Additional actions with Celerity can only be used for physical feats; one cannot use rapid- fire Dominate or Thaumaturgy with Celerity, for instance. As a general rule, Mental and Social Disciplines may not be activated during Celerity, except during Alacrity. Use of Celerity at the speed of Swiftness or above is generally considered a breach of the Masquerade. Note that a vampire need not use her full level of Celerity; a vampire with Advanced Celerity could simply rely on the Basic levels if desired."

Consequently, they wield power over perceptions, shaping their own illusions and crafting dreamstuff to their liking. With the Chimerstry Discipline, the Ravnos call on the energy of dreams and imagination, giving it form and phantasmic substance. This Discipline’s powers can conjure almost any shade that springs to mind, though plausible effects or du- plications of things that the conjurer has experienced are much more likely to fool viewers and victims. With enough mastery, the vampire can even give such illusions shadow-substance, causing injury to others. These illusions vanish only if dispelled by the creator, if the illusionist ceases concentrating on her creations or if they are banished by a disbelieving opponent who exerts enough presence of mind to prove the illusion’s nonexistence (say, by shoving a hand through an illusory wall). Chimerical illusions can only create, not remove — thus, they may add ele- ments to a scene, but cannot cause something to become invisible. Chimerstry could cover up something’s features but not remove selected parts. Furthermore, each illusion is a single object; one use of Chimerstry cannot create an entire host of illusory sensations or items. Chimerical creations must be free-standing items or sensory effects — a chimerical piece of clothing could conceal someone’s real appearance, but a chimerical stake could not suddenly materialize inside of someone’s chest (though it could later seem to be thrust there). Retests with Chimerstry use the Subterfuge Ability, as they attempt to trick, deceive and mislead."

Some few, however, are even more powerfully resilient, able to shrug off the most severe wounds and even resist the powers of fire and sunlight for a short time.

While using the Mask of a Thousand Faces, your features seem bland and unre- markable. Most often, people will describe you in vague, general terms relating to your normal appearance, but without any specifics, unique features or details. (Nosferatu and Samedi in particular find this power useful for assuming a semblance of their mortal countenances.) If you expend a Mental Trait, you may assume a specific set of features instead, causing those who look on you and who do not pierce your disguise to see, hear and smell the form that you choose. Thus, you can make your hair seem to be of a different color, change your apparent facial features, or seem to exude the smell of a specific perfume (or no smell at all). Note, though, that this power does not change the appearance of anything that you wear or carry — only your physical features are obscured. A Mask of a Thousand Faces remains until you fall asleep, are knocked unconscious or torpid, or are killed. You still use your normal Social Traits while using the Mask of a Thousand Faces. You can copy an image of fewer Traits deliberately, but if you hope to masquerade as someone with more Social Traits, you must expend Blood Traits to match that person’s total Social Traits. Otherwise, your appearance and mannerisms mysteriously fail to convey the person’s countenance properly. You cannot use the Mask of a Thousand Faces to assume more Social Traits than your generation would allow you to possess, so you may have difficulty duplicating the incredible grace of an elder.

With an effort, you can throw your disguising powers over several people, hiding them all from view or masking them with hallucinatory guises. To use Cloak the Gathering, you must spend one Mental Trait for each subject cloaked. You can then exert any Obfuscate power that you possess over the targets. Thus, you could choose to spread several Masks of a Thousand Faces over your allies, making them all look like different people (or even making some look like clones), or you could shroud a group with Vanish from the Mind’s Eye, causing them all to fade from view. When you exert this power, you must meet all of the normal conditions for the Obfuscate that you extend — you cannot cast Cloak of Shadows over someone who is not hidden behind cover or shadows, for instance. If you cause a group of people to Vanish from the Mind’s Eye, you need only make one Mental Challenge to extend the effect over your entire group. Anyone who bests you sees through the cloak, while anyone who loses to you fails to notice anyone under the cloak. You can only cast out a power that you are using, and you can only extend one power at a time. Individuals under the effects of Cloak the Gathering still sense one another nor- mally. Of course, a cloaked individual could use his own Obfuscate powers to remain unnoticed to other people under the cloak. If an individual under Cloak the Gathering violates the provisions of his loaned Obfuscate in some way (say, by launching an attack), then he immediately loses the benefits, but the cloak itself remains intact. Only if you violate your Obfuscate does the cloak fail. Similarly, if a character with Auspex attempts to breach your concealment, individuals noticed under the cloak do not compromise the protection for everyone else, but if you are noticed, then the entire cloak fails. Cloak the Gathering only throws your Obfuscate over other creatures or entities.

        description: "As creatures of cunning, intrigue and misdirection, Cainites possess an uncanny knack for deception and stealth. For some, though, this ability goes far beyond normal subterfuge. Such vampires actually cloud the minds of people around them, dulling notice and directing attention elsewhere. As a result, these vampires can remain obscured from observation, perhaps even extending their concealing powers to other objects and people. The powers of Obfuscate are often employed by the Assamites in their assassination work, and by the Followers of Set, who surreptitiously ferret out secrets and watch over their quarry. Malkavians use this power to escape notice when engaged in their insane activities. The undisputed masters of this Discipline, though, are the Nosferatu, who use its mind-numbing powers to gather secrets and hide their fearful countenances. Because Obfuscate clouds the awareness of its targets, they avoid notice of a concealed individual and to rationalize away such attention unless it is forced on them. Thus, if a vampire is concealed with this Discipline while wandering about a room, people avoid her subconsciously. If she sits in a chair while hidden, others ignore the chair, taking other seats or standing but failing to notice her innocuous presence or the 'mysteriously empty' seat. This concealment is generally broken if the hidden individual deliberately interacts with the environment, by picking up or dropping something, speaking to some- one, touching a person or manipulating an object — the amount of concealable activity varies with this Discipline’s power, as shown in the individual levels. The concealment of Obfuscate functions against all of the senses, because it actually forces attention away from the hidden individual. Thus, the presence of a Nosferatu wandering about with Unseen Presence is not betrayed by any telltale odor of the sewers. Cross your arms in front of your chest to represent your use of Obfuscate, displaying a number of fingers on each hand corresponding to your highest level of power (one for Basic, two for Intermediate, three for Advanced). The Discipline of Auspex can sometimes be used to pierce the veil of Obfuscate. An individual with Auspex (or a similar power of supernatural sensitivity) may penetrate Obfuscate if he is already looking for hidden individuals. The searcher may engage in a Mental Challenge with the hidden subject. For each level of difference between the subject’s Obfuscate and the searcher’s Auspex, there is a Trait modifier on a one-for- one basis to the outcome of ties or overbids. If the searcher wins, then he pierces the Obfuscate and senses the hidden vampire normally. If the concealed individual wins, the searcher remains oblivious to her presence. Thus, if a vampire with Vanish from the Mind’s Eye (an Intermediate power) uses Obfuscate while trying to evade a vampire with only Heightened Senses (a Basic power), the hiding vampire gains a two-Trait bonus on the Mental Challenge, and if successful, he remains unseen. This bonus applies even if the sneaking vampire uses a lower level of Obfuscate than he actually possesses, so us- ing Unseen Presence is still potent against low levels of Auspex if the vampire actually has Intermediate or Advanced Obfuscate. Similarly, simple Heightened Senses and the like gain the full benefit of the vampire’s best level of Auspex, so a vampire with Psychic Projection is extremely difficult to fool, even if only using the Basic levels of sensory powers. Obfuscate powers last as long as they are maintained, and they generally require no particular effort. These powers conceal the user and everything worn or carried. The Stealth Ability is used for retests by augmenting the Discipline with natural shadows and concealment. Hidden individuals cannot use Willpower to defend against Auspex challenges to Obfuscate (they cannot 'will' themselves into a more hidden state)."

                description: "Your strength daunts even other Cainites. Few would dare to cross you in a test of physical power. You are far more likely than the average vampire to succeed in challenges of strength. With Might, you may make a single retest on any challenge of sheer physical strength. Thus, if you are grappling, picking up a heavy object or breaking something, you can use Might as a retest. Once you invoke Might, it is the last test of the challenge; no further retests are allowed. Might costs nothing to use. You may use Might even if your opponent attempts to evade your strength. Your power is so startling that even an opponent who attempts to outlast you with stamina or to dodge you with quickness can be overcome, as long as you rely solely on your strength. Doing so generally requires you to bid a strength-related Trait, such as the types of Traits restorable with Prowess. Obviously, if you cannot exert your Might, you cannot make this retest — thus, you cannot use Might at range, with a thrown object (requiring speed and accuracy). You could use Might while trying to grab at a dodging opponent, but not when picking up and throwing a heavy object.",

You can heft hundreds of pounds with ease, deliver enough force to crush bones in a single blow and hammer down any opponent of lesser strength. When you possess Vigor, you may use the Bomb in challenges of strength. The Bomb is a closed fist with the thumb sticking up. The Bomb defeats Rock and Paper, ties with other Bombs and loses to Scissors (the fuse is cut). You are not required to use the Bomb, but you must always state before a Physical Challenge that you are capable of doing so. Using Vigor costs nothing. Your use of Vigor requires you to use only your strength; your opponent may try to defend with stamina or speed, but his doing so does not prevent you from using the Bomb.",

Whenever you enter a challenge of strength, you may use Potence as your bid Trait. This Trait does not count toward totals when resolving ties or overbids, but it can never be lost; thus, you may continually use Potence in successive tests of strength. Only if you are forced to risk multiple Traits — such as due to wounds or Negative Traits — do you risk losing any of your other Physical Traits. If  you run out of Physical Traits, you cannot use this Discipline. Once you have been completely exhausted, you can no longer enter challenges.",

With Puissance, you win all ties in tests of strength automatically. You need not compare Traits at all, unless some other factor would cause you to lose ties (such as wounds) or give the opponent the ability to win all ties as well (such as Fleetness). Furthermore, your incredible strikes inflict an additional health level of damage in combat. This bonus applies to any attack in which your strength is a factor — unarmed combat or combat with melee weapons. However, use of this incredible strength almost certainly breaks weapons that are not specially designed to stand it.",

        description: "All vampires are capable of preternatural strength by human standards, simply through the use of blood. With Potence, though, this strength extends far beyond such measures. The inhuman might of Potence is sufficient to allow a vampire to break bones, shatter stone, even heft and destroy heavy or resilient objects. Vampires using Potence in battle are fearsome indeed, delivering telling blows that fell even their undead adversaries. Most uses of Potence above the Basic levels are considered a breach of the Masquerade among Camarilla Kindred. The Potence Discipline is most commonly known by the Brujah, Giovanni, Lasombra and Nosferatu clans, all of whom prize physical strength and prowess. As Potence is a highly useful capability and requires little effort on the part of the vampire in question, many Cainites seek out tutors in this Discipline. The Potence Discipline, as a physically augmenting Discipline, does not use any Ability for retests other than the Ability commonly associated with whatever task is at hand. That is, when striking someone while using Potence, one should use the normal Brawl Ability for retesting."
